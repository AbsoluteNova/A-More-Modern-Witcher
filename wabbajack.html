            <h1>Wabbajack</h1>
            <p>Wabbajack is an automated installer for the mods and MO2. This install allows for minimal user
                intervention, basically, you don't have to do as much work.</p>

                        file</a> by clicking "A.More.Modern.Witcher.wabbajack"</li>
                <li>Create a new folder anywhere outside of any default Windows folders, and the game folder itself. I
                    recommend making a Modding folder in your root directory and a Wabbajack folder inside of it.
                </li>
                <p><code>"C:\Modding\Wabbajack"</code></p>
                <li>Place the downloaded "Wabbajack.exe" and "A.More.Modern.Witcher.wabbajack" in this folder</li>
                <li>Run "Wabbajack.exe"</li>
                <li>Select Install From Disk</li>
                <li>Where it says "Target Modlist", click the three dots, then locate and select
                    "A.More.Modern.Witcher.wabbajack" inside our "Modding\Wabbajack" folder</li>
                <li>Create a new folder inside "Modding", call it "A More Modern Witcher"
                </li>
                <p><code>"C:\Modding\A More Modern Witcher"</code></p>
                <li>Where it says "Modlist Installation Location", click the three dots and select the folder:
                </li>
                <p><code>"C:\Modding\A More Modern Witcher"</code></p>
                <li>Create a new folder inside "Modding" called "Downloads"
                </li>
                <p><code>"C:\Modding\Downloads"</code></p>
                <li>Where it says "Resource Download Location", click the three dots, and select the folder:</li>
                <p><code>"C:\Modding\Downloads"</code></p>
                <li>Wabbajack should look similar to this:</li>

                <li>Begin the installation by clicking the green arrow.</li>
                <li>Accept the Nexus Mods API request</li>
                <li>If you are not a Premium user you will need to manually click download for each mod.</li>
                <li>Once complete, the installation will show a green Installation Complete screen, you are safe to
                    close Wabbajack.</li>

                <li>
                    If you see a red Installation Failed screen, try logging in through Wabbajack's settings, then
                    reinstall the list to the same folder.

            <h3>Installing Reshade</h3>
            <hr>
            <ol class="outer-list">
                <li>Download the lastest <a href="https://reshade.me/">Reshade</a><strong> WITH FULL ADD-ON
                        SUPPORT</strong></li>
                <li>Run the setup tool</li>
                <li>Find and select Witcher.exe inside the system folder of your game. Typically: <br>
                    <code>"Steam\steamapps\common\The Witcher Enhanced Edition\Data\Override"</code>
                </li>
                <li>Select <strong>Vulkan</strong> as the rendering api, since we're using dxvk to convert d3d9 commands
                    to vulkan</li>
                <li>Checkmark the following packs</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>SweetFX by Ceejay.dk</li>
                    <li>Legacy effects</li>
                    <li>FXShaders by luluco250</li>
                    <li>qUINT by Marty McFly</li>
                    <li>Color effects by prod80</li>
                    <li>dh-reshade-shaders by AlucardDH</li>
                    <li>Insane-Shaders by Lord of Lunacy</li>
                    <li>AstrayFX</li>
                    <li>iMMERSE by Marty Mcfly</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Click run inside of MO2, from now on only launch the game through MO2. Mods will only load through
                    MO2</li>
                <li>Once loaded into the game, hit "home" on your keyboard to open reshade.</li>
                <li>Click Skip Tutorial</li>
                <img class="reshade-images" src="images/skip-tutorial.png" alt="">
                <li>Select the dropdown at the top, scroll down until you find WitcherReshade.ini, select the file and
                    click Select</li>
                <img class="reshade-images" src="images/select-dropdown.png" alt="">
                <li>Select Performance mode at the bottom of the page. This will fully compile and lock in settings,
                    netting you more performance. If you want to change specific settings in filters you can turn it off
                    and on at your will.
                </li>
                <img class="reshade-images" src="images/performance-mode-off.png" alt="">
                <img class="reshade-images" src="images/performance-mode-on.png" alt="">
                <li>Click on the add-ons tab</li>
                <img class="reshade-images" src="images/add-ons-tab.png" alt="">
                <li>Enable "Copy depth buffer during frame to prevent artifacts", this should also enable "Copy depth
                    buffer before clear operations". This will allow reshade to access the depth buffer and inject
                    ambient occlusion and other effects.
                </li>
                <img class="reshade-images" src="images/depth-buffer.png" alt="">
                <li>That's it! Your game should now be modded and playable as intended. You can continue to add some
                    more overhaul mods that couldn't be included in Wabbajack or continue playing!</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Additional Mods - Manual Installation</h2>
            <p>There are some mods I couldn't include in the WabbaJack installation due to them being hosted on Moddb,
                so to get the full experience you'll have to install these manually yourself. Fortunately I've left a
                guide here to do so. </p>

                <li>Click the big red "Download Now" button</li>
                <li>This mod is packaged in an exe file, so we need to handle it differently than we would with a
                    typical loose file mod.</li>
                <li>Create a file called "scabbards mod" somewhere easy to find, like your desktop.</li>
                <li>Execute the file, when it asks for your witcher game location point it to the <strong>folder you
                        just made instead</strong>.</li>
                <li>Select "The Witcher EE" when it presents you with a dropdown.</li>
                <li>Finish the download and you should be presented with this in your scabbards mod folder</li>

                <li>Right click Data, Select send to and then "Compressed (zipped) folder"</li>
                <li>Name it "Scabbards mod"</li>
                <li>Install "Scabbards mod.zip" into MO2</li>
                <li>Right click DATA and select "set as <data> directory", you should be given the following.</li>
